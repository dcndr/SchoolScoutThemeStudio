<h1>SchoolScout Theme Studio</h1>
<h3>Thanks for helping SchoolScout look its best, let's get you designing.</h3>

<p>Firstly, let's take a look around! 

**Open SchoolScout Theme Studio in a code editor or IDE, and open a local preview of 'index.html'**

It should look familiar as it is built off of BHHS SchoolScout (SchoolScout 4.2023). However, notes are disabled and times are frozen to allow design at any time.

</p>


<h2>Creating a New Theme</h2>

<p>Once you're ready, <strong>duplicate</strong> either the Red Envelope '23 (angpaostyles.css) or, Icy Mistletoe '22 (xmasstyles.css) themes and <strong>change the name.</strong> These files will be found under 'Stylesheets/'</p>

<p>Change any of the desired elements outlined in the CSS file, and keep design <strong>uniform.</strong></p>


<p>During the design process (or at the end if you're feeling confident), load your theme in the <strong>'Themes' panel</strong> in Theme Studio. Enter the <strong>new file name</strong> of stylesheet, and submit. It will now be saved in your browser and will reflect all changes of the theme, every refresh. </p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>Prevent changing, removing and opening <strong>non-theme files and elements</strong> to keep design uniform.</p>

<h3>Once completed, send .css files to themes@schoolscout.app to go live.</h3>
